# Zuba — React landing scaffold

This is a minimal Vite + React scaffold that reproduces the screenshot-style landing page. It references two images from the project's `assets` folder:

- `/assets/logo.png` (logo)
- `/assets/backgroug.png` (hero/right image)

Quick start:

1. Install dependencies:
```
npm install
```
2. Run dev server:
```
npm run dev
```

If your assets have different filenames, rename them to the names above or update the image paths in `src/components/Header.jsx` and `src/components/Hero.jsx`.
